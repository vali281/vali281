# 👋 Hi, I’m @vali281

- 👀 I’m interested in coding, editing, and building fun projects like Discord bots and games.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with Python for Discord bot development.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially related to game development and bot creation.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via Discord!  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a tic-tac-toe game for my Discord bot with a dynamic difficulty system!
